# HriProject

This is the code by Michaela Freed, Kat Allen, + Hally Bello for the HRI Fall 2021 Project.

To build the dog or gyroboy robot, view [EV3 building docs here](https://education.lego.com/en-us/product-resources/mindstorms-ev3/downloads/building-instructions#building-instructions-for-core-set-models). To build the car robot, view [Car building docs here](https://magbuhatrobotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/chapter-12.pdf).

Download the repository to the EV3 from VisualStudio. Then, in the File Browser on EV3 brick, select the appropriate form factor + behavior (main_[puppy|gyroboy|car]__[matching|mismatching].py).
